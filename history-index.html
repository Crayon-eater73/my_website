    <h1>The History Of My Blender Projects</h1>
    <h2>Town Hall</h2>
    <p>Making the Town Hall was difficult. There was a lot of details that were hard to get down correctly.&nbsp;Sometimes,&nbsp;it&nbsp;made&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole&nbsp;project&nbsp;break.</p>
    <!-- Infomation about Washingtions lakes and how they are formed -->
    <ol>
    <p>First, I started with the base blocks, getting an idea of what my project was going to look like.&nbsp;Then&nbsp;I&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;added&nbsp;more&nbsp;detail&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;blocks.</p>
